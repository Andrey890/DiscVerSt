Module 'vs' contains several classes that represent the vertical 
structure of accretion discs in X-ray binaries for different assumptions 
of opacity law. For given parameters the vertical structure of 
disc is calculated and can be used for research of disc stability.

Module 'mesa_vs' contains some additional classes, that represent 
the vertical structure for tabular opacities and convective energy transport.

'mesa2py' (https://github.com/hombit/mesa2py) is required for 'mesa_vs' structure for work.
