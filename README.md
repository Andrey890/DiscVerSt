Module 'vs' contains several classes that represent the vertical 
structure of accretion discs in LMXB for different assumptions 
of opacity law. For given parameters the vertical structure of 
disc is calculated and can be used for research of disc stability. 

For scientific-python course: project consist of setup.py, README (this file), 
Vertical_structure/__init__.py, Vertical_structure/vs.py, Vertical_structure/test.py 
and requirements.txt (use pip3 install -r requirements.txt to install all dependences).
